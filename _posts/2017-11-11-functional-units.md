The functional unit of the breast is the lobule, which is supported by a specialized intralobular stroma. The inner luminal epithelial cells produce milk during lacta- tion. The basally located myoepithelial cells have contrac- tile function to aid in milk ejection and also help support the basement membrane. The ducts are conduits for milk to reach the nipple. The size of the breast is deter- mined primarily by interlobular stroma, which increases during puberty and involutes with age. Each normal con- stituent is a source of both benign and malignant lesions (Fig. 19.22).
