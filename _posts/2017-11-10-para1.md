Three important features distinguish the breast from other organs. First, rather than being essential for survival, the major function is the nutritional support of another individual, the infant. Second, the structure of the organ undergoes marked changes throughout life: expansion of the lobular system after menarche, periodic remodel- ing during adulthood, especially during and after preg- nancy, and ultimately involution and regression of lobules. Finally, breasts are visible and as a result have a social, cultural, and personal signi cance not shared by other organs. All of these features play a role when consider- ing the origins, presentations, and treatment of breast disease.
