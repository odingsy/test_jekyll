The predominant symptoms and signs of diseases of the breast are pain, in ammatory changes, nipple discharge,  lumpiness,  or a palpable mass (Fig. 19.23A). However, few symptoms are so severe as to re uire treatment, and the primary reason for investigating their cause is to evalu- ate the possibility of malignancy. Most symptomatic breast lesions (>90 ) are benign. Of women with cancer, about 45  have symptoms, whereas the remainder come to atten- tion through screening tests (Fig. 19.23B).
- Pain (mastalgia or mastodynia) is a common symptom often related to menses, possibly due to cyclic edema and swelling. Pain localized in a speci c area is usually caused by a ruptured cyst or trauma to adipose tissue (fat necrosis). Almost all painful masses are benign, but for unknown reasons a small fraction of cancers (about 10 ) cause pain.
- Inflammation causes an edematous and erythematous breast. It is rare and is most often caused by infec- tions, which only occur with any fre uency during lactation and breastfeeding. An important mimic of inflammation is  in ammatory  breast carcinoma (discussed later). 
- Nipple discharge may be normal when small in unilatity and bilateral. The most common benign lesion pro- ducing a nipple discharge is a papilloma arising in the large ducts below the nipple (Fig. 19.22). Discharges that are spontaneous, unilateral, and bloody are of greatest concern for malignancy.
- Lumpiness,oradiffusenodularitythroughoutthebreast, is usually a result of normal glandular tissue. When pronounced, imaging studies may help to determine whether a discrete mass is present.
- Palpable masses can arise from proliferations of stromal cells or epithelial cells and are generally detected when they are 2 to 3 cm in size (Fig. 19.22). Most ( 95 ) are benign; these tend to be round to oval and to have circumscribed borders. In contrast, malignant tumors usually invade across tissue planes and have irregular borders. However, because some cancers grow decep- tively as circumscribed masses, all palpable masses re uire evaluation.
- Gnecomastia is the only common breast symptom in males. There is an increase in both stroma and epithelial cells resulting from an imbalance between estrogens, which stimulate breast tissue, and androgens, which counteract these effects.
